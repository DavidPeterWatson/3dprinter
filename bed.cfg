#   A newline separated list of X, Y coordinates describing the two
#   opposing corners of the gantry. The first entry corresponds to Z,

#   A newline separated list of four X, Y points that should be probed
#   during a QUAD_GANTRY_LEVEL command. Order of the locations is
#   important, and should correspond to Z, Z1, Z2, and Z3 location in
#   order. This parameter must be provided. For maximum accuracy,
#   ensure your probe offsets are configured.
